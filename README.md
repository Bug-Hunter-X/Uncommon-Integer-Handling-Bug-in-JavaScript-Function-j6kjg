# Uncommon Integer Handling Bug in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a simple JavaScript function. The function is intended to add two integers, but it incorrectly handles certain input combinations.  The bug is particularly difficult to spot if you focus only on basic test cases.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is designed to add two integers. However, it only explicitly handles scenarios where either of the inputs is zero.  For other integer values, the output might be unexpected and incorrect.

## Solution

The solution involves improving the function's logic to correctly and exhaustively handle all possible valid integer inputs.
